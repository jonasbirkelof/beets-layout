# Beets Layout

# About
Beets Layout is a CSS and JavaScript library that gives you some good layout fundation for your HTML or PHP projects. The focus is on dashboards but you can easily modify it to make it work with standard websites or single page applications.

Beets Layout can be used by itself with some css styling, but if you want a super simple start you can use it with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [documentation](https://jonasbirkelof.github.io/beets-css)!
