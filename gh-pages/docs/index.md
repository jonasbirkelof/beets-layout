# Welcome to Beets Layout

Beets Layout is a CSS and JavaScript library that gives you some good layout fundation. for your html or PHP projects. The focus is on dashboards but you can easily modify it to make it work with standard websites or single page applications.

The point of this framework is not to be extremely customizable and every design choice at your fingertips but rather have a good and fully functioning starting point. To get the quickest and best experience, you should use Beets Layout together with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), although it can be used with your own custom css or frameworks like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

!!! tip "Consider using Beets Layout with **[Beets CSS](https://github.com/jonasbirkelof/beets-css)** and **[Beets PHP](https://github.com/jonasbirkelof/beets-php)**"

Beets Layout is developed using Boostrap 5.2.X.
