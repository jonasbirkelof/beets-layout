## Source files

1. Download and unzip the source files: `beets-layout-va.x.x-src.zip`.
2. Move the folders `scss/beets-layout` and `js/beets-layout` to your resource folder in your project (from where you compile your resources, i.e. ~/resources/`). You could `@include` the file `beets-layout/beets-layout.scss` in your main `app.scss` file.
